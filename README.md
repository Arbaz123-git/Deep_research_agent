# Deep Research Agent 🤖

An AI-powered autonomous research assistant that conducts deep, iterative web research with self-validation and quality improvement.

## 🌟 What It Does

This agent goes beyond simple web searches - it conducts **multi-layered research** with intelligent follow-up questions, validates its own findings, and iteratively improves answers until they meet quality standards.

### Key Features
- **Deep Research**: Conducts 2-3 levels of follow-up research automatically
- **Self-Validation**: Evaluates answer quality and decides if more research is needed
- **Smart Summarization**: Handles large web content with AI-powered summarization
- **Rate Limit Resilience**: Built-in retry mechanisms for API stability
- **Structured Output**: Professional, well-cited research reports
- **Flexible Depth**: Configurable research depth (1-3 iterations)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Deep_research_agent

# Install dependencies using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Required API Keys
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

Get your API keys:
- **Groq API**: [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys)
- **Tavily API**: [tavily.ai](https://tavily.ai/#api)

### 3. Run Your First Research

```bash
# Interactive mode
python deep_agent.py

# Example usage
Enter your research question: How is AI transforming climate change mitigation?
Enter maximum research depth (1-3): 2
```

### 4. Programmatic Usage

```python
from deep_agent import conduct_research

# Conduct research on any topic
results = conduct_research(
    question="Impact of quantum computing on pharmaceutical research",
    max_depth=3
)

print(f"Quality Score: {results['validation_score']}")
print(f"Answer: {results['refined_answer']}")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The agent uses a **state graph architecture** with these key components:

### Research Pipeline
```
Question → Web Search → Draft → Refine → Validate → (Follow-up Research) → Final Answer
```

### Core Components

1. **Research Node**: Searches web using Tavily API
2. **Draft Node**: Creates initial content from search results
3. **Refine Node**: Improves structure and adds citations
4. **Validation Node**: Quality assessment and improvement suggestions
5. **Follow-up Generator**: Creates intelligent next research questions

### State Management
```python
class ResearchState(TypedDict):
    question: str                    # Research topic
    search_results: List[str]       # Web findings
    drafted_content: str           # Initial draft
    refined_answer: str           # Final answer
    follow_up_questions: List[str] # Next research directions
    research_depth: int          # Current depth level
    max_depth: int               # Configurable limit
    validation_score: float      # Quality assessment (0-1)
    validation_feedback: str      # Improvement suggestions
    needs_more_research: bool    # Continue flag
```

## 📊 Example Output

### Research Question: "How is AI transforming renewable energy?"

**Validation Score**: 0.87/1.0

**Research Results**:
```
## AI's Revolutionary Impact on Renewable Energy

### 1. Solar Energy Optimization
AI algorithms are increasing solar panel efficiency by 15-25% through:
- Dynamic positioning systems that track sun movement
- Predictive cleaning schedules based on weather patterns
- Real-time performance monitoring and fault detection

### 2. Wind Power Enhancement
Machine learning models optimize wind farm operations:
- Turbine blade angle adjustments for maximum energy capture
- Predictive maintenance reducing downtime by 30%
- Grid integration optimization during peak demand

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check environment variables
   python -c "import os; print(os.getenv('GROQ_API_KEY'))"
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Built-in exponential backoff retry
   - Maximum 3 retries with increasing delays

3. **Long Content Handling**
   - Automatic summarization for content >500 chars
   - Smart truncation with context preservation

4. **Network Issues**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Research Prompts
Modify the prompt templates in `deep_agent.py`:

```python
# In draft_node function
custom_prompt = f"""
Research {topic} specifically for {audience}.
Focus on {specific_aspect} with {timeframe} data.
Include {format_requirements}.
"""
```

### Batch Processing
```python
questions = ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", "Topic 3"]
for q in questions:
    results = conduct_research(q, max_depth=2)
    save_results(q, results)
```
