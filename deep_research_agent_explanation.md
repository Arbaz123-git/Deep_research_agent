# Deep Research Agent: An AI-Powered Academic Research Assistant

## Introduction

The Deep Research Agent is an advanced AI system designed to conduct comprehensive academic research by leveraging multiple information sources, including web search engines, academic databases like ArXiv and PubMed, and large language models. This agent is capable of generating well-structured, academically rigorous responses to complex research questions, complete with proper source attribution and validation.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of the Deep Research Agent is to automate and enhance the academic research process by:

1. **Conducting multi-source searches** across general web content, scientific papers, and academic publications
2. **Synthesizing information** from diverse sources into coherent, well-structured responses
3. **Generating follow-up questions** to deepen research on specific aspects of the topic
4. **Validating research quality** using academic standards and providing improvement feedback
5. **Maintaining source transparency** with detailed attribution for all information

## System Architecture

The Deep Research Agent is built as a directed graph of specialized nodes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the research process. This modular architecture allows for flexible research workflows and easy extension with new capabilities.

### Core Components

1. **LLM Integration**: The system uses ChatGroq as its primary language model for content generation and processing.
2. **Search Tools**: 
   - Tavily for general web search
   - ArXiv API for scientific papers
   - PubMed API for medical and biological research
3. **State Management**: A TypedDict called `ResearchState` maintains the research context throughout the process.
4. **Graph Structure**: A directed graph with conditional edges manages the research workflow.

## Implementation Details

### Research State Management

The system uses a TypedDict to maintain state throughout the research process:

```python
class ResearchState(TypedDict):
    query: str  # The original research question
    research_depth: int  # Current depth of research (increases with follow-ups)
    research_results: list  # Results from unified search
    draft: str  # Initial draft answer
    refined_answer: str  # Final polished answer with source attribution
    follow_up_questions: list  # Generated follow-up questions
    follow_up_research_results: list  # Results from researching follow-ups
    validation_score: float  # Quality score from validation
    validation_feedback: str  # Detailed feedback on research quality
    should_continue_research: bool  # Whether to pursue follow-up questions
    should_improve_research: bool  # Whether to improve based on validation
```

### Key Functional Nodes

#### 1. Research Node

The research node performs unified searches across multiple sources and processes the results:

```python
def research_node(state: ResearchState) -> ResearchState:
    """Perform research on the query and update the state with results."""
    print(f"DEBUG: Researching query: {state['query']}")
    
    # Perform unified search across sources
    results = unified_search(state["query"])
    
    # Process and store results
    if results:
        state["research_results"] = results
        print(f"DEBUG: Found {len(results)} results")
    else:
        print("DEBUG: No results found")
        state["research_results"] = []
        
    return state
```

#### 2. Draft Node

The draft node generates an initial answer based on the research results:

```python
def draft_node(state: ResearchState) -> ResearchState:
    """Generate an initial draft based on research results."""
    if not state["research_results"]:
        state["draft"] = "I couldn't find any relevant information on this topic."
        return state
    
    # Prepare context from research results
    context = prepare_llm_context(state["research_results"])
    
    # Generate draft using LLM
    prompt = f"""Based on the following research results, provide a comprehensive answer to the question: {state['query']}\n\nResearch Results:\n{context}"""
    
    response = llm_request_with_retries(prompt)
    state["draft"] = response
    
    return state
```

#### 3. Generate Follow-ups Node

This node creates follow-up questions to deepen the research:

```python
def generate_follow_ups_node(state: ResearchState) -> ResearchState:
    """Generate follow-up questions based on the current research."""
    # Skip if we've already gone deep enough
    if state["research_depth"] >= 2:
        state["follow_up_questions"] = []
        state["should_continue_research"] = False
        return state
    
    prompt = f"""Based on the following draft answer to the question '{state['query']}', generate 3 specific follow-up questions that would help deepen the research.\n\nDraft Answer:\n{state['draft']}"""
    
    response = llm_request_with_retries(prompt)
    
    # Extract questions from response
    questions = [q.strip() for q in response.split("\n") if q.strip() and "?" in q]
    state["follow_up_questions"] = questions[:3]  # Limit to 3 questions
    
    # Decide whether to continue with follow-ups
    state["should_continue_research"] = bool(questions)
    
    return state
```

#### 4. Research Follow-ups Node

This node conducts research on the follow-up questions:

```python
def research_follow_ups_node(state: ResearchState) -> ResearchState:
    """Research the follow-up questions to deepen the answer."""
    follow_up_results = []
    
    for question in state["follow_up_questions"]:
        results = unified_search(question)
        if results:
            follow_up_results.extend(results)
    
    state["follow_up_research_results"] = follow_up_results
    state["research_depth"] += 1
    
    return state
```

#### 5. Refine Node

The refine node integrates follow-up research and improves the answer with source attribution:

```python
def refine_node(state: ResearchState) -> ResearchState:
    """Refine the draft with follow-up research and add source attribution."""
    # Combine all research results
    all_results = state["research_results"]
    if "follow_up_research_results" in state and state["follow_up_research_results"]:
        all_results = all_results + state["follow_up_research_results"]
    
    # Prepare context from all results
    context = prepare_llm_context(all_results)
    
    # Generate source explanations
    sources_explanation = generate_source_explanation(all_results)
    detailed_sources = generate_detailed_source_list(all_results)
    
    # Refine answer with sources
    prompt = f"""Refine the following draft answer to the question '{state['query']}' using all research results.\n\nDraft Answer:\n{state['draft']}\n\nAll Research Results:\n{context}\n\nProvide a comprehensive, well-structured answer with clear sections. Include proper attribution to sources."""
    
    refined_answer = llm_request_with_retries(prompt)
    
    # Add source transparency section
    state["refined_answer"] = f"{refined_answer}\n\n{sources_explanation}\n\n{detailed_sources}"
    
    return state
```

#### 6. Validation Node

The validation node evaluates the quality of the research answer:

```python
def validation_node(state: ResearchState) -> ResearchState:
    """Validate the quality of the research answer."""
    # Determine if academic validation is needed based on query
    is_academic = is_academic_query(state["query"])
    
    validation_criteria = """
    1. Completeness: Does the answer address all aspects of the question?
    2. Accuracy: Is the information factually correct and up-to-date?
    3. Depth: Does the answer provide sufficient depth on the topic?
    4. Structure: Is the answer well-organized with clear sections?
    5. Citation Quality: Are sources properly attributed and reliable?
    """
    
    if is_academic:
        validation_criteria += """
        6. Academic Rigor: Does the answer meet academic standards?
        7. Source Quality: Are academic sources like journals and papers used?
        8. Balanced Perspective: Does it present multiple viewpoints?
        """
    
    prompt = f"""Evaluate the quality of the following research answer to the question '{state['query']}' based on these criteria:\n{validation_criteria}\n\nAnswer to Evaluate:\n{state['refined_answer']}\n\nProvide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 and detailed feedback on each criterion. Then indicate if more research is needed."""
    
    response = llm_request_with_retries(prompt)
    
    # Extract score and feedback
    score_match = re.search(r"Score:\s*([0-9.]+)", response)
    score = float(score_match.group(1)) if score_match else 0.5
    
    state["validation_score"] = score
    state["validation_feedback"] = response
    
    # Determine if research should be improved
    state["should_improve_research"] = score < 0.7
    
    return state
```

#### 7. Improve Research Node

This node generates new follow-up questions based on validation feedback:

```python
def improve_research_node(state: ResearchState) -> ResearchState:
    """Generate new follow-up questions based on validation feedback."""
    prompt = f"""Based on the following validation feedback for the research answer to '{state['query']}', generate 3 specific follow-up questions that would address the weaknesses identified.\n\nValidation Feedback:\n{state['validation_feedback']}\n\nCurrent Answer:\n{state['refined_answer']}"""
    
    response = llm_request_with_retries(prompt)
    
    # Extract questions from response
    questions = [q.strip() for q in response.split("\n") if q.strip() and "?" in q]
    state["follow_up_questions"] = questions[:3]  # Limit to 3 questions
    state["should_continue_research"] = True
    
    return state
```

### Graph Structure

The research workflow is implemented as a directed graph with conditional edges:

```python
# Create the graph
graph = Graph()

# Add nodes
graph.add_node("research", research_node)
graph.add_node("draft", draft_node)
graph.add_node("refine", refine_node)
graph.add_node("generate_follow_ups", generate_follow_ups_node)
graph.add_node("research_follow_ups", research_follow_ups_node)
graph.add_node("validation", validation_node)
graph.add_node("improve_research", improve_research_node)

# Set entry point
graph.set_entry_point("research")

# Add edges
graph.add_edge("research", "draft")
graph.add_edge("draft", "generate_follow_ups")

# Conditional edges
graph.add_conditional_edge(
    "generate_follow_ups", 
    lambda state: "research_follow_ups" if state["should_continue_research"] else "refine",
    ["research_follow_ups", "refine"]
)

graph.add_edge("research_follow_ups", "refine")
graph.add_edge("refine", "validation")

graph.add_conditional_edge(
    "validation", 
    lambda state: "improve_research" if state["should_improve_research"] else "END",
    ["improve_research", "END"]
)

graph.add_edge("improve_research", "research_follow_ups")

# Compile the graph
compiled_graph = graph.compile()
```

## Search Integration

The agent integrates multiple search sources through a unified search function:

```python
def unified_search(query: str) -> list:
    """Perform a unified search across multiple sources."""
    results = []
    
    # Web search via Tavily
    try:
        tavily_results = search_tool.invoke({"query": query})
        if tavily_results:
            for result in tavily_results:
                results.append({
                    "title": result.get("title", "Untitled"),
                    "content": result.get("content", ""),
                    "url": result.get("url", ""),
                    "source_type": "web"
                })
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Tavily search error: {e}")
    
    # ArXiv search
    try:
        arxiv_results = search_arxiv(query)
        results.extend(arxiv_results)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"ArXiv search error: {e}")
    
    # PubMed search
    try:
        pubmed_results = search_pubmed(query)
        results.extend(pubmed_results)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"PubMed search error: {e}")
    
    return results
```
